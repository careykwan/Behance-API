##Terminal Commands
This project requires a server therefore if you are using a Vagrant server please ensure you have Node JS install inside the server.

### Installing Packages
When you have cloned the project, please install the node_module packages with:

`$ npm install`

### Grunt Commands
We have used Grunt as our task runner therefore to get things running run the following commands in two seperate terminal tabs.

#### Open Server

`$ grunt server`

#### Run Sass compiler, Concat, Linting

`$ grunt w`


## JavaScript Style Guide
- Use single quotations within the JavaScript files.
- Use Tabs for indentations.
- Use camel case in JavaScript file as hyphenation are reserved for css and html naming.
- Have appropriate discriptive variable names.
- Have space between operators.
- Do not have objects written compressed on one line.
- Place the opening bracket on the same line as the object name and closing bracket on it own line.


## Best Practices
- All members coding their sub projects should only be coding within their project files to avoid constant conflict during commits. 
- To avoid conflicts every member has been assigned a number to differenciate class and id names for css styling, the number will be added to every name created at the end. Unless certain IDs are required in order for pages to link.
- Each memeber must not work on the master branch, therefore they must work on their own seperate branches.

- The best practices we are following, will be the [Yoobee School of Design Web Best Practices](http://yoobee.net.nz/BestPractices/) guildlines, mainly focusing on the Client Side Best Practices section.
